# Electromagnetic-Simulations
MATLAB code to compute and visualize the TE and TM modes of a rectangular waveguide.
The wave equation is first solved on paper for an MxN grid using Finite Differences Method. The grid matrix will provide the eigenvectors(Electric or Magnetic field) and the contour lines are plotted.
The code was written in MATLAB R2019a. Copy and paste the script and It will print the first 4 modes for each field.
